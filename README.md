# NetworkDesign

This is the code repository for the paper named "Rapid transit network design via convex optimization: the role of sparsity and entropy-based regularizers".

This repository provides the necessary files to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper. It is composed of three folders.  

These folders are:  

•⁠  ⁠*3-Node Network*: Associated with the experiments in sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.

•⁠  ⁠*6-Node Network*: Associated with the experiments in section 6.1.3.

•⁠  ⁠*9-Node Network*: Associated with the experiments in sections 6.2 and 6.3.

•⁠  ⁠*Sevilla 24-Node Network*: Associated with the experiments in section 6.4.1.

•⁠  ⁠*Sevilla 51-Node Network*: Associated with the experiments in section 6.4.2.

•⁠  ⁠*Sevilla Scalability*: Associated with the experiments in section 6.4.3.
